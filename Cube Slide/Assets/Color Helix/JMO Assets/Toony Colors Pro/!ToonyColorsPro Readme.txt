UPDATE NOTES
------------
2.3.31
- disabled debug mode in Shader Generator (was mistakenly left enabled in the previous update)

2.3.3
- Shader Generator: updated template to use Unity 5's surface shader model by default
 * this will improve compatibility with built-in features (e.g. Light Probe Proxy Volumes)
 * visuals should stay the same as they were, but you can use Unity 4 model if that's not the case
 * please send me a bug report if you notice something wrong
- Shader Generator: major update to the Texture Blending feature:
 * now based on vertex colors or texture map
 * can blend up to 5 textures using RGBA + black color
 * height-based blending for more realistic transition between textures (also added to Terrain template)
- Shader Generator: added Triplanar mapping option
- Shader Generator: added "Ramp Control" and "Ramp Style" features:
 * separated ramp controls per light type, or main/secondary lights
 * "RGB Slider" option, allows a different threshold per color channel (good for skin subsurface approximation)
 * shaders using the "Separated Ramps" option will switch to these new options
- Shader Generator: added Point and Spot light built-in falloff textures bypass:
 * will remove the usage of Unity's built-in falloff textures
 * ramp settings will be based on a linear falloff, based on the light's settings
 * you can define a custom falloff texture when combining this with the new Ramp Control feature
- Shader Generator: added Alpha To Coverage transparency option
- Shader Generator: added custom Light Wrapping factor option
- Shader Generator: added Specular workflow option (Standard PBS Template)
- Shader Generator: added ignore main texture and/or color alpha options for Alpha Blending & Testing
- Shader Generator: Subsurface Scattering is always using the Light's color now
- Shader Generator: added Gradient Ramp option for Dissolve
- Shader Generator: Dissolve doesn't clip by itself now, you need to enable Alpha Testing (Cutout) to get the old behavior
- Shader Generator: added UV1 option for Masks' independent UVs (to use secondary UVs from the mesh)
- Shader Generator: added height-based blending for Terrain template
- Shader Generator UI: reorganized sections with labels
- Scripts: TCP2_GetPosOnWater doesn't update the custom time value anymore, use TCP2_ShaderUpdateUnityTime instead
- Shaders: new default color values for highlight/shadows, should look more like the Default material
- Material Inspectors UI improvements
- updated documentation and reorganized sections to match Shader Generator
- fixed harmless console errors related to material inspector (hopefully!)

2.2.45
- added "Normal Map Blending" option for "Vertex Texture Blending" feature
- updated the "Sketch" effects in the Shader Generator:
 * the screen-space texture will be offset based on the object's position, removing the 'shower door' artefact
 * go back to the old behavior by enabling the 'Disable Obj-Space Offset' option
 * removed 'Scale with Model' option, now integrated with the new object-space offset
 * the UVs aren't multiplied with the resolution anymore, giving consistent texture scale across resolutions
- updated "Subsurface Scattering" in the Shader Generator:
 * separated Ambient Color and Color
 * additive mode is now the default behavior for more consistency, use "Multiplicative" option for previous behavior
 * fixed shadows affecting subsurface with directional lights
